# CSAPP-datalab
This is a note for the solution of datalab, our task is to accomplish the functions in the file **bit.c** following the rules. The following is the functions list.

```
Score   Rating  Errors  Function
 1      1       0       bitXor
 1      1       0       tmin
 1      1       0       isTmax
 2      2       0       allOddBits
 2      2       0       negate
 3      3       0       isAsciiDigit
 3      3       0       conditional
 3      3       0       isLessOrEqual
 4      4       0       logicalNeg
 4      4       0       howManyBits
 4      4       0       floatScale2
 4      4       0       floatFloat2Int
 4      4       0       floatPower2
Total points: 36/36
```

All of the functions is done independently except *howManyBits*, which I refered this blog [CSAPP 之 DataLab详解，没有比这更详细的了](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/59534845).


Some of the code can be inproved or simplified.

The lab is not so difficult if you read the book carefullly.:)
